            <span><b>Every day, international issues are in the news headlines – this is your chance to become an expert on relations between states, economies, ideas and societies. In a world where nuclear weapons remain primed for use, the world economy teeters on the brink of collapse and delicate ecosystems are under threat, it is little wonder that our International Relations degree is proving a popular choice among students who wish to better understand the world’s most challenging problems.</b></span>
            <span>
              International Relations is a multidisciplinary subject, which draws in contributions from politics, history, media, sociology, law, economics and religion. Global issues dominate the news headlines on a daily basis and International Relations will allow you to focus on this dimension of politics. This is an opportunity to become an expert in international issues in a historical, political and cultural context.
            </span>
            <span>
              All our academics are conducting internationally published research. Our key strengths are in Theories of International Relations; Peace and Conflict; British and US foreign policy and EU politics. Our subject deals squarely with some of the most daunting, intractable but important challenges of today.

              Liverpool Hope can also offer work placement opportunities via our Careers hub. In Politics we’ve also organised a Practitioners in Politics series of events, in conjunction with our Careers Office, where individuals including MPs, the Mayor of Liverpool and the Merseyside Commissioner for Crime and Policing have come to advise students on pathways into politically oriented careers and the skills needed to get there.

            <p class="col-title">Course structure</p>
            <p>Teaching on this degree is structured into lectures, seminars, and tutorials which typically have no more than 10 students in the first year. You also have the opportunity to have a one-to-one meeting with your tutor each week.</p>
            <br><p>For the International Relations part of your Combined Honours degree, there are approximately 6 teaching hours each week, which reduces to approximately 5 teaching hours in your second and third years. On top of teaching hours, you are also expected to spend a number of hours studying independently each week, as well as studying in groups to prepare for any group assessments you may have. You are expected to spend an average of 40 hours per week devoted to your studies, including taught hours and independent study.</p>
            <p class="col-title">Assessment and feedback</p>
            <p>Assessments are varied and consist of a formal exam focusing on lecture topics, and a range of written coursework assignments. You will be given clear, generic and additional assessment criteria at the start of the degree and at appropriate points throughout your studies. In your final year, you will complete a special study or dissertation. </p>
            <br><p>Assessment is regarded as an important aid to learning and the team recognises the importance of providing timely, high-quality, constructive written feedback to you that not only explains the strengths and weaknesses of the particular piece of work but which also makes clear what must be improved in future work. This also applies to exam scripts - feedback is given to you on a form and is discussed with you in the following autumn. Feedback is provided verbally to the whole year group where possible, to emphasise points of general relevance. You are also provided with individual written feedback and will have the opportunity either in class time or in 'drop in' office hours to discuss your work privately with the tutor.  </p>
